title: Upgrading PXF
---

If you are using PXF in your current Greenplum Database installation, you must upgrade the PXF service when you upgrade to a new version of Greenplum Database.

The PXF upgrade procedure describes how to upgrade PXF in your Greenplum Database installation. This procedure uses *PXF.from* to refer to your currently-installed PXF version and *PXF.to* to refer to the PXF version installed when you upgrade to the new version of Greenplum Database.

Most PXF installations do not require modifications to PXF configuration files and should experience a seamless upgrade.

**Note**: Starting in Greenplum Database version 5.12, PXF no longer requires a Hadoop client installation. PXF now bundles all of the JAR files on which it depends, and loads these JARs at runtime.

The PXF upgrade procedure has two parts. You perform one procedure before, and one procedure after, you upgrade to a new version of Greenplum Database:

-   [Step 1: PXF Pre-Upgrade Actions](#pxfpre)
-   Upgrade to a new Greenplum Database version
-   [Step 2: Upgrading PXF](#pxfup)


## <a id="pxfpre"></a>Step 1: PXF Pre-Upgrade Actions

Perform this procedure before you upgrade to a new version of Greenplum Database:

1. Log in to the Greenplum Database master node. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    ```

3. Stop PXF on each segment host as described in [Stopping PXF](cfginitstart_pxf.html#stop_pxf).

4. **If you are upgrading from Greenplum Database version 5.14 or earlier**:

    1. Back up the *PXF.from* configuration files found in the `$GPHOME/pxf/conf/` directory. These files should be the same on all segment hosts, so you need only copy from one of the hosts. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ mkdir -p /save/pxf-from-conf
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ scp gpadmin@seghost1:/usr/local/greenplum-db/pxf/conf/* /save/pxf-from-conf/
        ```

    2. Note the locations of any custom JAR files that you may have added to your *PXF.from* installation. Save a copy of these JAR files.

6. Upgrade to the new version of Greenplum Database and then continue your PXF upgrade with [Step 2: Upgrading PXF](#pxfup).


## <a id="pxfup"></a>Step 2: Upgrading PXF

After you upgrade to the new version of Greenplum Database, perform the following procedure to upgrade and configure the *PXF.to* software:

1. Log in to the Greenplum Database master node. For example:

    ``` shell
    $ ssh gpadmin@<gpmaster>
    ```

2. Initialize PXF on each segment host as described in [Initializing PXF](init_pxf.html).

3. PXF user impersonation is on by default in Greenplum Database version 5.5.0 and later. If you are upgrading from an older *PXF.from* version, you must configure user impersonation for the underlying Hadoop services. Refer to [Configuring User Impersonation and Proxying](pxfuserimpers.html) for instructions, including the configuration procedure to turn off PXF user impersonation.

4. **If you are upgrading from Greenplum Database version 5.14 or earlier**:

    1. If you updated the `pxf-env.sh` configuration file in your *PXF.from* installation, re-apply those changes to `$PXF_CONF/conf/pxf-env.sh`. For example:

        ``` shell
        gpadmin@gpmaster$ vi $PXF_CONF/conf/pxf-env.sh
           <update the file>
        ```
    2. Simlarly, if you updated the `pxf-profiles.xml` configuration file in your *PXF.from* installation, re-apply those changes to `$PXF_CONF/conf/pxf-profiles.xml` on the master host.

        **Note:** Starting in Greenplum Database version 5.12, the package name for PXF classes was changed to use the prefix `org.greenplum.*`. If you are upgrading from an older *PXF.from* version and you customized the `pxf-profiles.xml` file, you must change any `org.apache.hawq.pxf.*` references to `org.greenplum.pxf.*` when you re-apply your changes.
    3. If you updated the `pxf-log4j.properties` configuration file in your *PXF.from* installation, re-apply those changes to `$PXF_CONF/conf/pxf-log4j.properties` on the master host.
    4. If you updated the `pxf-public.classpath` configuration file in your *PXF.from* installation, copy every JAR referenced in the file to `$PXF_CONF/lib` on the master host.
    5. If you added additional JAR files to your *PXF.from* installation, copy them to `$PXF_CONF/lib` on the master host.
    5. Starting in Greenplum Database version 5.15, PXF requires that the Hadoop configuration files reside in the `$PXF_CONF/servers/default` directory. If you configured PXF Hadoop connectors in your *PXF.from* installation, copy the Hadoop configuration files in `/etc/<hadoop_service>/conf` to `$PXF_CONF/servers/default` on the Greenplum Database master host.
    5. Starting in Greenplum Database version 5.15, the default Kerberos keytab file location for PXF is `$PXF_CONF/keytabs`. If you previously configured PXF for secure HDFS and the PXF keytab file is located in a *PXF.from* installation directory (for example, `$GPHOME/pxf/conf`), consider relocating the keytab file to `$PXF_CONF/keytabs`. Alternatively, update the `PXF_KEYTAB` property setting in the `$PXF_CONF/conf/pxf-env.sh` file to reference your keytab file.

5. Synchronize PXF configuration from the master host to each Greenplum Database segment host. For example:

    ``` shell
    gpadmin@gpmaster$ $GPHOME/pxf/bin/pxf cluster sync
    ```
 
6. Start PXF on each segment host as described in [Starting PXF](cfginitstart_pxf.html#start_pxf).
